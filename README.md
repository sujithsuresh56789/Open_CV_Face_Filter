🚀 OpenCV Snapchat Filter Project 📸

Overview:
I spearheaded a project employing OpenCV to craft an interactive Snapchat-inspired filter. By integrating computer vision techniques, I successfully achieved real-time facial feature detection and augmented reality overlays on live video streams.

Achievements:

🔍 Facial Detection: Implemented Haarcascades for precise facial feature detection across diverse lighting conditions.
🎭 AR Overlay: Developed image processing algorithms for seamless integration of virtual elements onto facial landmarks, enhancing user engagement.
⚙️ Real-time Processing: Optimized the application for swift, responsive filter application to live video feeds.
Technologies:

👁️‍🗨️ OpenCV: Leveraged its extensive tools for robust image and video processing.
💻 Python: Wrote clean, efficient code for real-time performance.
🚀 AR Concepts: Incorporated augmented reality for an interactive user experience.
Future Plans:

🌐 Web Integration: Exploring integration into web applications.
📲 Mobile App: Adapting the project for smartphones.
Outcome:
This project showcases my proficiency in computer vision and image processing, combining technical skills and creativity for an engaging Snapchat-like filter. Open to collaboration and further discussions!
